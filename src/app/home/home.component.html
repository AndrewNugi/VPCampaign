            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>My name is Sharon Johnson, and I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Arts in International Studies. 
                I have a deep passion for outdoor activities, animals, and exploring new cultures, 
                which fuels my enthusiasm for meeting new people and discovering diverse perspectives. 
                I find joy in music, art, and graphics, and I am particularly drawn to marketing, event planning, 
                and program and project management. My approach to these fields is guided by strong problem-solving 
                skills, empathy, and patience. I am dedicated to community service and prioritize kindness and 
                consideration in my interactions. As a people-oriented individual and a good listener,
                I thrive on connecting with others and contributing positively to those around me.
